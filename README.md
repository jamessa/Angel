# Symmetric 60%

A staggered yet ergonomic 60% keyboard.

## Idea

A slightly ergonomic keyboard that fits into 60% form factor. ![Layout](assets/layout.jpg)


 ## Featuring

* Staggered yet ergonmic ![Staggered yet Ergonomics](assets/staggered_yet_ergonomics.jpg)

* Maximize hand distance ![hand distance](assets/hand_distance.jpg)

* Arrow keys are must.

* Fitts' law is respected. Four corner keys are maximized while [you shall no call its name] is break into 3 keys.  The gaint space bar is a huge waste ot thumb(s). It breaks into 1.25, 1.5, 1.25 to free it up. My favorite combination is, <kbd>backspace</kbd>, <kbd>enter</kbd>, <kbd>whitespace</kbd>.

* 60% form factor which should fix your notebook perfectly.

* all keys are under 1.75u which means no stablizer is required. Period.

##  Cons

It's incompatible to traditioal keycaps layout. **CAPS LOCK** is the only 1.75u key on traditional keyboard. In Symmetric 60%, 4 is required but you can always swap into smaller keycaps at your wish.

[Symmetric Stagger 60%]( https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=66965.0)  by Jesse Vincent, Keyboardio ![Symmetric Stagger](https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=66965.0;attach=84939;image) While I wait for the Model 01 boards to come back from Shenzhen, I've been messing around with a symmetric stagger 60% layout. Before I go and get 5 PCBs made, I'd love layout feedback from folks.

[Katana 60](https://deskthority.net/viewtopic.php?t=16287&start=30) by rominronin, 2017 Novenember. it's a beauty. ![Katana 60](https://i.imgur.com/1yvw1uQ.jpg) ps. the character in the middle is åˆ€ which means sword in Chinese and Japanese.
